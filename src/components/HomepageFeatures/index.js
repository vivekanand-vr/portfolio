          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio website! I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building robust and scalable web applications. I specialize in utilizing popular frameworks such as Spring Boot and React to create dynamic and interactive user experiences. With a strong foundation in Java and JavaScript, I strive to deliver high-quality code that adheres to industry best practices.
          <br></br>
          I have mentioned my projects in the <a href='/projects'>Projects</a> section.

          <p>
          In addition to my technical expertise, I find joy in engaging in intellectual pursuits outside of programming. Chess has been a long-standing passion of mine, as it allows me to sharpen my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. When I'm not immersed in code or contemplating my next chess move, I find solace in the challenge of solving Rubik's Cube puzzles, pushing my mind to unravel complex patterns and algorithms.
